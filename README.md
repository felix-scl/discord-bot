# Discord Bot (CodingChallenges.fyi)

Following the https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-discord challenge.

I decided to build it with Python after so much time not using the language. Went with py-cord for the discord wrapper as it has extensive documentation.

## Built with (main packages)

- Py-cord
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
